# Python-peer-to-peer-lending
The goal of the project is to build a simplified and proof-of-concept software application for peer-to-peer lending or social lending, which is a service managed by an internet company that acts as a financial intermediary for matching money lenders and borrowers with a reduced overhead comparing with traditional banking systems. We assume that the software will be used by some operator of the financial intermediary company. The software is composed of a user interface and business logic part written in Python and an SQL database management system to store the data.
